  ## Description

  Using some pregenerated code, I created a software engineering team generator command line application.  It prompts the user for information about various team members and their roles, and then generates a team roster via HTML for viewing.  The project was also required to pass all written tests included in the pregenerated code.

  ## Installation

  

  ## Usage

  From the application folder, run terminal, install all dependencies, and then run the app.js file using node.  You will then be prompted for information related to your team members.  At the end of each member, you will be asked if you want to add additional team members, or to end the program and generate the HTML.

  ## Tools

  The following tools were used in the development of this project:
   HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, Node.js

  ## License

  

  ## Roadmap

  Refinement of the HTML elements would be a top priority, and the an expansion of roles and relevant information.
